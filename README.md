# odin-recipes 

In this project, I will be using my new knowledge of HTML to create a basic Recipe website, with pages that link
to various recipes. By the end of this project, I will have demonstrated my ability to create various HTML elements, 
utilize different lists and bold/italicize, and create links that are connected to various pages.
