      <p>
        Buffalo wings are an American classic, originating from the famous Anchor Bar in Buffalo, NY. 
        Whether it's a mid-week dinner or a weekend sport night, this delicious meal is truly a 
        joy to have on any occasion. They are also versatile - by altering the mix of butter and hot sauce, 
        or by adding spice, you can truly customize the heat profile to your heart's content! 
      </p>

      <p>
        This specific recipe is a great mix of spices and heat. Utilizing the ever-popular Frank's RedHot Sauce
        as well as cayenne pepper (and blending it all with butter), this simple recipe is sure to make family 
        and friends excited to come back for seconds every time. This recipe uses 20 wings, but is very easy 
        to double or even triple for any occasion! Careful though - one taste of these and I'm sure you 
        won't be in the market to share!

      <ol>
        <li>Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil, and lightly grease with cooking spray.</li>
        <li>
          Place flour, cayenne pepper, garlic powder, and salt into a resealable plastic bag, 
          and shake to mix. Add chicken wings, seal the bag, and toss until well coated with the flour mixture. 
          Transfer wings to the prepared baking sheet and refrigerate for at least 1 hour.
        </li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
        <li>
          While the oven is preheating, whisk together melted butter and hot sauce in a small bowl. 
          Dip wings into butter mixture, and place back on the baking sheet.
        </li>
        <li>
          Bake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes. 
          Flip wings and continue to cook until crispy on the outside and 
          no longer pink in the center, about 25 more minutes.
