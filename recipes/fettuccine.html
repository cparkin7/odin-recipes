      <p>
        Another Italian Favorite, this next dish is a dish best kept <em>simple</em>. It is very
        easy to over-complicate the ever-popular Fettuccine Alfredo, so in this recipe we will 
        keep it simple and let the ingredients do the work! 
      </p>

      <p>
        With just a handful of ingredients that are almost always available in the pantry 
        or the fridge, this is a delicious dinner for any night of the week! Plus, you 
        can add a variety of meats (my favorite is chicken!) to really spice the dish up. 
        For a feels-good classic, you can't beat Fettuccine Alfredo!

      <ul>
        <li>24 ounces dry fettuccine pasta</li>
        <li>1 cup butter</li>
        <li>3/4 pint heavy cream</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 dash garlic salt</li>
        <li>3/4 cup grated Romano cheese</li>
        <li>1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="sh">Steps</h3>

      <ol>
        <li>
          Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add fettuccine and 
          cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain.
        </li>
        <li>
          In a large saucepan, melt butter into cream over low heat. Add salt, 
          pepper and garlic salt. Stir in cheese over medium heat until melted; 
          this will thicken the sauce.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add pasta to sauce. Use enough of the pasta so that all of the sauce 
          is used and the pasta is thoroughly coated. Serve immediately.
        </li>
      </ol>
